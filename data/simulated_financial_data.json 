  "currentFinancialNarrative": "Springfield Independent School District maintains a balanced budget primarily through state and local funding. While existing federal grants support targeted programs, there is a significant need for dedicated funding to address large-scale initiatives, such as district-wide technology upgrades and specialized STEM program enhancements. Our current operational budget for technology covers maintenance and incremental replacements but is insufficient for transformative projects. We are actively seeking grant opportunities to bridge this gap and achieve our strategic priorities without impacting essential services.",
