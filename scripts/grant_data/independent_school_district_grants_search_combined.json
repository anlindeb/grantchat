To date, the COPS Office has been appropriated more than $21 billion to advance community policing, including grants awarded to more than 13,000 state, local, territorial, and tribal law enforcement agencies to fund the hiring and redeployment of nearly 140,000 officers.\n\nCOPS Office information resources, covering a wide range of community policing topics such as school and campus safety, violent crime, and officer safety and wellness, can be downloaded via the COPS Office’s home page, https://cops.usdoj.gov. \nThe FY25 School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) provides funding directly to states, units of local government, Indian tribes, and their public agencies to improve security at schools and on school grounds in the recipient’s jurisdiction through evidence-based school safety programs. The COPS Office anticipates that up to $73,000,000 will be available for up to $500,000 per award, with approximately 200 awards anticipated. A local cost share (matching funds) of at least 25 percent in the form of cash is required unless a match waiver is requested and approved, and the period of performance duration will be 36 months, with a period of performance start date of 10/1/25.\nApproximately $1 million of the available funding will be reserved for microgrants for school districts, including rural, tribal, and low-resourced schools. Applications for microgrants must not exceed $100,000, and the COPS Office will waive the 25 percent local cost share (matching funds) requirement for microgrant applicants that are selected for funding. Consideration for microgrant funding does not exclude your agency from consideration from non-microgrant SVPP funding. \n\nApplications should demonstrate a comprehensive approach to school safety and activities must fall within one of the statutory purpose areas (see 34 U.S.C. § 10551(b)(5)–(9)):\n•\tCoordination with local law enforcement;\n•\tTraining for local law enforcement officers to prevent student violence against others and self;\n•\tPlacement and use of metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other deterrent measures;\n•\tAcquisition and installation of technology for expedited notification of local law enforcement during an emergency;\n•\tAny other measure that, in the determination of the COPS Office Director, may provide a significant improvement in security.",

        "description": "Listing a plant or animal as federally protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is proven to be successful in preventing extinction. However, this level of protection is America’s last line of defense. Before a species may warrant listing and protections under the ESA, many voluntary conservation opportunities can be undertaken. Voluntary actions can improve conditions for species and improve habitats for at-risk, listed, and common species alike.  At-risk species conservation is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) initiative promoting proactive conservation of fish, wildlife, and plants with partners before the species warrant protections under the ESA. The FWS collaborates with all partners (Federal and State agencies, Tribes, private landowners, non-government organizations, and industries) across all landscapes to implement this initiative. The FWS’s at-risk species efforts are intended to encourage and support voluntary actions that proactively conserve species and their habitats. We believe that if we work with partners to improve the status of species before they come to the FWS for review under the ESA, we may be able to reduce the impact of stressors and stabilize or increase populations. Ideally, this proactive conservation work may help us avoid listing these species, thus improving species and their habitat, while simultaneously reducing regulatory burden.",

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Children’s Bureau (CB) recognizes that every child who dies as a result of child abuse or neglect represents an irreversible and deep trauma to families and communities. Preventing child fatalities is an urgent public health concern that demands meaningful action. Understanding the circumstances surrounding the tragedy of a child fatality through improved data collection, reporting, and analysis of all child fatalities is essential for prevention. The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to establish, by cooperative agreement, the National Center on Child Maltreatment Fatality Data Practices (the National Center) to improve data collection and reporting about child maltreatment fatalities. Effective cross-agency coordination and understanding of child maltreatment fatality data can help states collect comprehensive data. States, jurisdictions, and their partners, including tribes, can use that information to develop cross-agency prevention, intervention, and system reform efforts.The National Center will make and carry out a plan to provide culturally responsive T/TA to states, jurisdictions, and their partners, including tribes. This will enable these groups to better execute the goals of this funding and measure the effectiveness of implemented efforts. The National Center will focus on the following objectives: Building knowledge and capacity.Increasing opportunities for cross-agency cooperation and coordination.Establishing a national resource for information-sharing, learning, and dissemination.Supporting data practice and reporting strategies.Evaluating training and technical assistance activities.",

Through the use of this mechanism, the NIDDK is seeking to enhance the capability of its K01, K08, K23, and K25 award recipients to conduct research as they complete their transition to fully independent investigator status. The R03 grant mechanism supports different types of projects, including pilot and feasibility studies; secondary analysis of existing data; small, self-contained research projects; development of research methodology; and development of new research technology. The R03 is, therefore, intended to support research projects that can be carried out in a short period of time with limited resources and that may provide preliminary data to support a subsequent R01, or equivalent, application.",

        "description": "The purpose of this announcement is to encourage grant applications for investigator-initiated prospective observational comparative effectiveness research (CER) to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). The study must address questions within the mission and research interests of the NINDS and may evaluate preventive strategies, diagnostic approaches, or interventions including drugs, biologics, and devices, or surgical, behavioral, and rehabilitation therapies. Information about the mission and research interests of the NINDS can be found at the NINDS website (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/). Studies proposed should provide a cost-effective means of collecting data with a meaningful bearing on current clinical practice. Awards made under this FOA will initially support a milestone-driven planning phase (UG3) for up to 2 years, with possible transition to a observational study phase of up to five years (UH3). Only UG3 projects that have met the scientific milestones and feasibility requirements may transition to the UH3 phase. The UG3/UH3 application must be submitted as a single application, following the instructions described in this FOA.  The UG3 phase for observational studies will permit both scientific and operational planning activities. Scientific planning activities include small-scale data collection to assess the feasibility and/or acceptability of data collection, storage, and planned analyses. Operational planning activities include, at a minimum, development of recruitment and retention strategies, case report forms, data management system and other tools for data and quality management. The UH3 phase of the award will support the conduct of investigator-initiated observational study.",

Structural and functional aspects, including visualizing dynamic elements, are important to developing new and improved techniques. Projects may also focus on developing new imaging probes or contrast agents that can enhance visualization of the inner ear structures. Research supported in response to this RFA is expected to significantly advance the ability to visualize auditory and vestibular components, such as hair cells, otoliths, membranes, ions, and vasculature, in detail in awake patients in a clinical setting using non-invasive techniques. To achieve this goal, a multidisciplinary team approach that takes advantage of the expertise of each team member is highly encouraged.

The NHLBI expects that applications to this NOFO will describe the planned clinical trial and in so doing demonstrate that the proposed (R34) research is scientifically necessary to design or plan the subsequent trial. Furthermore, this NOFO will support research projects that are designed to provide results that will be sufficient to inform the future trial without further studies. The planned Phase II, III, or IV trial must be primarily intended to test the efficacy, safety, clinical management, or implementation of intervention(s) in the prevention and/or treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. In contrast to the study start up or preparation phase of NHLBI funding opportunities for clinical trials (as described at https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/funding-opportunities-and-contacts/clinical-trials-optimization), the R34 mechanism is intended to provide new information that answers a scientific or operational question(s) which may be pragmatic in nature and, therefore, informs the final development of a Phase II-IV clinical trial. Regardless of the results of the R34, support of the proposed future clinical trial will require a new application.",

        "description": "<p>The principal objective of this funding opportunity is to support opportunities for tribes, and/or tribal entities, and underserved communities to meaningfully engage in coastal habitat restoration activities. NOAA anticipates up to $20 million will be available under this opportunity, of which up to 15% will specifically be available as direct awards and subawards to Indian tribes (as defined in 25 U.S.C. Section 5304 (e)) and Native American organizations that represent Indian tribes through formal legal agreements (e.g. tribal commissions, tribal consortia, tribal conservation districts, and tribal cooperatives). The remaining funding will be available to all eligible applicants. Funding will prioritize capacity building, meaningful engagement, and restoration project activities that enhance resilience of tribes, tribal entities, and underserved communities and have the greatest potential to lead to habitat restoration in coastal, estuarine, marine, and Great Lakes areas. This funding opportunity is authorized under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) (BIL, Public Law 117-58), 135 STAT. 1356 (Nov. 15, 2021). This funding opportunity does not have a formal matching requirement. Projects that are most responsive to the program priorities will be more competitive. Potential activities include: 1) capacity building, which may include (but is not limited to) participation in municipal or regional-scale resilience planning, project planning and feasibility studies, stakeholder engagement, proposal development for future funding, and outreach and education, as well as hiring of staff to increase capacity to support the planning, design and implementation of restoration actions, as well as capacity to support overall award management including tracking, reporting, and project coordination/development; 2) meaningful engagement, which may include (but is not limited to) engaging the community through educational opportunities, community discussions, and/or paid experiences that support the successful execution of the proposed project activities; 3) restoration project activities, including for demonstration projects, which may include engineering and design, permitting, on-the-ground restoration, and pre- and post project implementation monitoring. Competitive applications will directly benefit tribes or underserved communities. Applicants may apply for funding to support one or more of these activities. This funding opportunity supports NOAA’s efforts to enhance coastal resilience. Coastal areas support the nation’s largest and often fastest-growing population centers, as well as key natural assets. Strengthening coastal resilience means preparing and adapting coastal communities to mitigate the impacts of and more quickly recover after extreme events such as hurricanes, coastal storms, flooding, and sea level rise. Habitat restoration and natural and nature-based solutions are critical to doing so by: protecting lives and property; sustaining commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing; recovering threatened and endangered species; and maintaining and fostering vibrant coastal economies and lifestyles. This funding opportunity – along with those for National Oceans and Coastal Security Fund Grants, Climate Resilience Regional Challenge Grants, Transformational Habitat Restoration and Coastal Resilience Grants, Coastal Zone Management, and National Estuarine Research Reserves – aims to fund projects that enhance coastal resilience. This funding opportunity in particular focuses on building organizational and technical capacity and/or supporting restoration activities that benefit tribes, tribal entities, and/or underserved communities and enhance their resilience to climate hazards. Through this funding opportunity, NOAA offers funding for tribes, tribal entities, and/or underserved community applicants to meaningfully engage their communities through outreach and education throughout the project. Meaningful engagement ensures community members are integral to the visioning, decision-making, and leadership for coastal habitat restoration projects that may affect their environment, and/or health and well-being. For applicants demonstrating a connection to tribes, tribal entities, and/or underserved communities, meaningful engagement of tribes, tribal entities, and/or underserved communities is intended to ensure that community members are integral to the visioning, decision-making, and leadership for coastal habitat restoration projects; to ensure that the scope of such projects are inclusive of the priorities and needs of communities; and/or to ensure that the benefits of such projects flow back to tribes, tribal entities, or underserved communities. NOAA is committed to the goals of advancing equity and support for underserved communities. NOAA encourages applicants to include and demonstrate principles of diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility through proactive, meaningful, and equitable community engagement in the identification, design, and/or implementation of proposed projects. NOAA also encourages applicants to appropriately consider and elevate local or Indigenous knowledge in project design, implementation, and evaluation. Applicants should identify if the project is located within tribal or underserved communities and/or whether a portion of the resilience benefits from the proposed work will flow to tribes, tribal entities, or underserved communities. This program will advance the Biden/Harris Administration’s Justice40 Initiative. Established by Executive Order 14008 on Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, the Justice40 Initiative set the goal that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain federal investments, such as climate, clean energy, and other areas, flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment. Proposals selected for funding through this opportunity will be funded through cooperative agreements. NOAA encourages a period of performance of up to three years, with the potential for up to five years, if necessary and approved by NOAA.&nbsp;NOAA anticipates typical federal funding for awards will range from $250,000 to $1 million over three years. NOAA will not accept proposals with a total federal funding request of less than $75,000 or more than $2 million for the entire award. Projects requesting the upper limit of funding are expected to implement restoration actions in addition to capacity-building and meaningful engagement, versus being solely focused on capacity-building and/or meaningful engagement activities. Priority will be given to activities with the highest certainty to occur within a 2-3 year award period. Funds will be administered by the NOAA Office of Habitat Conservation, as directed by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</p>",

As part of their applications, applicants must demonstrate their status as, or connection to, a tribe, tribal entity, and/or an underserved community. This status or connection will be reviewed by NOAA as part of the initial eligibility review, and through the application merit review process. NOAA will validate the applicant’s description against publicly available demographic and economic data. Up to 15% of the funding in this opportunity is only available to Indian tribes (as defined in 25 U.S.C. Section 5304 (e)) and Native American organizations that represent Indian tribes through formal legal agreements (e.g. tribal commissions, tribal consortia, tribal conservation districts, and tribal cooperatives). Funding to Indian tribes and Native American organizations may be direct awards or subawards. 25 U.S.C Section 5304 (e) states that “Indian tribe” or “Indian Tribe” means any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (85 Stat. 688) [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians. Applicants demonstrating a connection to a tribe, tribal entity and/or an underserved community may do this through proposed subawards, contracts, informal collaboration, or other engagement with, or approval of, one or more tribes, tribal entities, and/or underserved communities. The application will be evaluated based on the strength of the partnership with the underserved community or communities. The partner submitting the application is required to provide supporting documentation in the application demonstrating that they have been endorsed by one or more tribes, tribal entities, and/or underserved communities for the specific work proposed. The documentation may be provided in the form of letters of support from one or more tribes, tribal entities, and/or underserved communities for the specific work proposed, and should be attached with other Supplemental Materials. Applications from federal agencies or employees of federal agencies will not be considered. However, federal agencies or employees may serve as unfunded collaborative project partners. Foreign entities should participate as partners (contractors, sub-recipients, or informal collaborators) of a prime recipient based in the U.S. Applicants must propose work in coastal, estuarine, marine, or Great Lakes areas (see Section I.A. for a definition of coastal areas). Eligible applicants for Great Lakes projects must propose work within the Great Lakes basin within one of the eight U.S. Great Lakes states (New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Minnesota).

This program will support the early-stage proof of concept, high-risk and potentially high-reward studies for feasibility and exploratory technology development, which can transform or significantly improve the efficiency of therapeutic development to achieve NCATS ultimate goals - more treatments to all people more quickly. The research proposed should be for the development of technology that can break new ground or extend present technology toward new directions or novel applications. With this initiative, we expect to support the development and/or prototyping of new technologies that will lead to improved efficiency in the therapeutic development pipeline.",

The purpose of this Centers program is to accelerate innovation of diabetes translation to maximize positive impacts of research on population health through activities and core services that offer specialized expertise, tools, education, and support. An emphasis on novel methods and research to address health equity and reduce diabetes-related health disparities is encouraged. Novel research cores designed to improve other aspects of person-centered, community, and population health are also encouraged with justification of how such findings or strategies may be adapted to meaningfully inform disparity-reduction approaches. A scientific base reflecting academic institutions and diverse organizational collaborators (e.g., healthcare systems, community organizations, health departments, human services) is expected to foster a Center framework necessary for improving population health. CDTRs are based on the core concept whereby shared resources aimed at fostering productivity, synergy, and novel research ideas among the funded investigators are supported in a cost-effective manner.",

        "description": "A central goal of the BRAIN Initiative is to understand how electrical and chemical signals code information in neural circuits and give rise to sensations, thoughts, emotions and actions. While currently available technologies can provide some understanding, they may not be sufficient to accomplish this goal. For example, non-invasive technologies are low resolution and/or provide indirect measures such as blood flow, which are imprecise; invasive technologies can provide information at the level of single neurons producing the fundamental biophysical signals, but they can only be applied to tens or hundreds of neurons, out of a total number in the human brain estimated at 85 billion.Other BRAIN FOAs seek to develop novel technology (RFA-NS-17-003) or to optimize existing technology ready for in-vivo proof-of-concept testing and collection of preliminary data (RFA-NS-17-004) for recording or manipulating neural activity on a scale that is beyond what is currently possible. This FOA seeks applications for unique and innovative technologies that are in an even earlier stage of development than that sought in other FOAs, including new and untested ideas that are in the initial stages of conceptualization.In addition to experimental approaches, the support provided under this FOA might enable calculations, simulations, computational models, or other mathematical techniques for demonstrating that the signal sources and/or measurement technologies are theoretically capable of meeting the demands of large-scale recording or manipulation of circuit activity in humans or in animal models. The support might also be used for building and testing phantoms, prototypes, in-vitro or other bench-top models in order to validate underlying theoretical assumptions in preparation for future FOAs aimed at testing in animal models.",

All applications submitted under this NOFO must be supported by sufficient preliminary data demonstrating  bioavailability (if applicable) and documentation that the natural product produces a reproducible and measurable impact on target engagement (i.e., measure of the mechanism of action). Only in cases when it is not possible/practical to measure target engagement in the patient population of interest or when there is a fundamental understanding of the products mechanism of action will this preliminary data requirement be waived. \nApplications submitted to this NOFO should propose a mid-phase clinical trial to do the following: determine the optimal dose or formulation of a given natural product for use in a future multi-site efficacy trial; or determine which patient phenotypes will be responders versus non-responders to the natural product to inform inclusion/exclusion criteria of a future efficacy trial. Clinical trials submitted under this NOFO are expected to be hypothesis based, milestone-driven, and directly related to the research priorities and mission of NCCIH. This NOFO will not support single-site or multi-site efficacy or effectiveness trials, nor will it support trials to test natural products for the treatment or prevention of cancer. \nApplicants are encouraged to contact the appropriate NCCIH Scientific/Research contact for the area of science for which they are planning to develop an application prior to submitting to this NO",

Awards made under this FOA will initially support a milestone-driven planning phase (UG3) for up to 2 years, with possible transition to a clinical trial implementation phase (UH3) of up to five years. Only UG3 projects that have met the scientific milestones and feasibility requirements may transition to the UH3 phase. The UG3/UH3 application must be submitted as a single application, following the instructions described in this FOA. The UG3 phase will permit both scientific and operational planning activities. Scientific planning activities include small-scale data collection to assess the feasibility and/or acceptability of a planned behavioral or social intervention and associated study procedures (e.g., acceptability of study content or mode of delivery; feasibility of proposed data collection procedures; preliminary testing of intervention training and fidelity monitoring procedures). Operational planning activities include, at a minimum, development of: the final clinical protocol; the intervention manual or equivalent; the data management system and other tools for data and quality management, safety and operational oversight plans; recruitment and retention strategies; and other essential documents. The UH3 phase will support the conduct of investigator-initiated intervention research at all stages, from early mechanistic research and intervention development (e.g., Stages 0/ I) through implementation and cost-effectiveness research (Stages IV/V).",

OSH surveillance may include population/group- and case-based approaches and activities. Funded programs are expected to be resourceful and proactive in identifying and accessing data sources for OSH surveillance, which may include adding or developing occupation data within public health data systems, creating linkages between data sources, or developing new methods for OSH surveillance. Through this funding announcement, NIOSH seeks to continue and strengthen OSH surveillance programs within states and other eligible jurisdictions to provide information that will help drive actions to improve the health and safety of workers in the US. This program will build upon existing public health practice, capacity, and expertise in OSH surveillance.

This NOFO is a key element of NIMHs set of NOFOs to support clinical trials research across the intervention development and testing pipeline. The NOFO supports (1) clinical trials to test the effectiveness of optimized therapeutic and preventive interventions for use in community and practice settings; and (2) clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of patient-, provider-, organizational-, or systems-level services interventions to improve access, continuity, quality, equity, and/or value of mental health services.  This NOFO is intended to support trials that: address a significant problem, such that the findings have potential to inform practice; are adequately powered to definitively answer the primary research question(s), with well-justified hypotheses supported by pilot data; and are designed to examine questions regarding mediators and moderators of effects. Consistent with the NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, this NOFO is intended to support effectiveness trials that explicitly address whether the intervention engages the target(s)/mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects (i.e., the mechanism(s) that accounts for changes in clinical/functional outcomes, changes in provider behavior, improved access or continuity of services, etc.). The collaborative R01 mechanism provides support for multisite trials when two or more sites are necessary for completion of the trial (e.g., to increase sample size, accelerate recruitment, or increase sample diversity and representation).",

The NOFO will support milestone-driven early stage trials in pediatric and adult populations. First in human (FIH) and Phase II studies of novel agents must assess target engagement (brain exposure), pharmacological effects, safety, and tolerability to assess feasibility for Phase II/proof of concept (PoC) studies in psychiatric disorders. Phase II/PoC studies must evaluate the drugs impact on clinically relevant physiological systems (functional measures) and clinical indicators of effect. The NOFO also supports FIH and early feasibility studies (EFS) of novel devices to evaluate target engagement, safety, tolerability, and efficacy. The overall objective is to facilitate rapid collection of data to \"de-risk\" novel mechanism of action investigational drugs, novel drugs for use in pediatric populations with psychiatric disorders, and devices or combination treatments in order to attract private or other public funding for further clinical development as FDA-approved treatments. A key aspect of this NOFO is the formation of collaborative partnerships between the biomedical researchers and biotechnology or industry researchers to facilitate psychiatric drug or device development.",

The intent of this NOFO is to support research that advances (1) prevention approaches to reduce prenatal alcohol exposure and the incidence of FASD and that (2) interventions for FASD. These objectives will be accomplished with the Exploratory/Developmental Phased Award (R61/R33) mechanism, clinical trial optional. The R61 phase will support pilot studies or secondary data analysis for hypothesis development and feasibility, and research testing the hypotheses can be expanded in the R33 phase. The transition to the R33 phase will be determined by NIAAA program staff after evaluation of the achievement of specific milestones set for the R61 phase. Highest priority will be given to applications with clinical trials. Applicants interested in planning clinical trials or adding to current projects may also consider NOFO (TEMP-23832, the R34 option).",

The Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will support efforts to optimize and evaluate measures of neurophysiological processes that are disrupted within or across mental disorders in both healthy humans and in another species relevant to the therapeutic development pipeline. The initiative will support initial proof of concept studies aimed at identifying measures for potential development as preclinical assays for evaluating potential new drug and device therapies and their targets. Data will also reveal assay measures where the performance between preclinical animal species and humans is dissimilar, thus establishing a firm basis for limiting speculative extrapolations of preclinical animal findings to humans. The ultimate practical goal of this NOFO is to improve the efficiency of the therapeutic development process by identifying coherence of measures and inconsistencies between the preclinical screening pipeline and clinical evaluation of new treatment candidates and thereby hasten the development of more effective treatments for mental disorders.",

NCCIH expects that applications to this NOFO will describe the planned future clinical trial and in so doing demonstrate that the proposed (R01) research is scientifically necessary to design or plan the subsequent fully powered, full-scale clinical trial. Under this R01, the data collected should be used to fill gaps in scientific knowledge, including, but not limited to the following: assessing whether the intervention can be delivered with fidelity across sites; demonstrating feasibility of recruitment, accrual, and randomization of participants across sites; demonstrating participant adherence to the intervention, as well as retention of participants throughout the study across sites; refining and assessing the feasibility of protocolized multimodal interventions, and/or demonstrating feasibility of data collection across sites in preparation for a future fully powered, multisite efficacy or effectiveness trial. The need for multisite feasibility trials is expected to be justified by sufficient preliminary data from previous single site feasibility or acceptability trial(s) or the published literature. The data collected should be used to fill gaps in scientific knowledge and be necessary to develop a competitive fully powered multisite clinical trial that has the potential to make a significant impact on public health.",

        "description": "This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) encourages research on the biology of high confidence risk factors associated with complex brain disorders, with a focus on the intracellular, transcellular and circuit substrates of neural function. For the purposes of this NOFO, the term complex can refer to a multifactorial contribution to risk (e.g., polygenic and/or environmental) and/or highly distributed functional features of the brain disorder. Studies may be either hypothesis-generating (unbiased discovery) or hypothesis-testing in design and may utilize in vivo, in situ, or in vitro experimental paradigms, e.g., model organisms or human cell-based assays. While behavioral paradigms and outcome measures can be incorporated into the research design to facilitate the characterization of intracellular, transcellular and circuit mechanisms, these are neither required nor expected. Studies should not attempt to model disorders but instead should aim to elucidate the neurobiological impact of individual or combined risk factor(s), such as the affected molecular and cellular components and their relationships within defined biological process(es). This can include the fundamental biology of these factors, components and processes. The resulting paradigms, component pathways and biological processes should be disseminated with sufficient detail to enrich common and/or federated data resources (e.g., those contributing to the Gene Ontology, Synaptic Gene Ontology, FAIR Data Informatics) in order to bridge the gap between disease risk factors, biological mechanism and therapeutic target identification. The present NOFO (R21 activity code) can be used for applications to develop early stage, high-risk, exploratory approaches or establish proof-of-concept where there is little or no preliminary data. Applicants proposing to develop lines of inquiry where feasibility or proof of concept has been established should apply to the companion R01 NOFO (PAR-xx-xxx).",

        "description": "This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) encourages research on the biology of high-confidence risk factors associated with complex brain disorders, with a focus on the intracellular, transcellular, and circuit substrates of neural function. For the purposes of this NOFO, the term complex can refer to a multifactorial contribution to risk (e.g., polygenic and/or environmental) and/or highly distributed functional features of the brain disorder. Studies may be either hypothesis-generating (unbiased discovery) or hypothesis-testing in design and may utilize in vivo, in situ or in vitro experimental paradigms, e.g., model organisms or human cell-based assays. While behavioral paradigms and outcome measures can be incorporated into the research design to facilitate the characterization of intracellular, transcellular, and circuit mechanisms, these are neither required nor expected. Studies should not attempt to model disorders but instead should aim to elucidate the neurobiological impact of individual or combined risk factor(s), such as the affected molecular and cellular components and their relationships within defined biological process(es). This can include the fundamental biology of these factors, components, and processes. The resulting paradigms, component pathways, and biological processes should be disseminated with sufficient detail to enrich common and/or federated data resources (e.g., those contributing to the Gene Ontology, Synaptic Gene Ontology, FAIR Data Informatics) in order to bridge the gap between disease risk factors, biological mechanism and therapeutic target identification. The present NOFO (R01 activity code) can be used for applications to further develop lines of inquiry where feasibility or proof-of-concept has been established. Applicants proposing exploratory research at the early and conceptual stages of project development should apply to the companion R21 NOFO PAR-24-025",

The new tools and technologies should inform and/or exploit cell-type and/or circuit-level specificity. Plans for validating the utility of the tool/technology will be an essential feature of a successful application. The development of new genetic and non-genetic tools for delivering genes, proteins and chemicals to cells of interest or approaches that are expected to target specific cell types and/or circuits in the nervous system with greater precision and sensitivity than currently established methods are encouraged. Tools that can be used in a number of species/model organisms rather than those restricted to a single species are highly desired. Applications that provide approaches that break through existing technical barriers to substantially improve current capabilities are highly encouraged.",

The mission of IMPC is to generate a comprehensive catalogue of mammalian gene function that will provide the foundation for functional analyses of human genetic variation. The current (July 19, 2022) IMPC data release includes phenotypic data for 8260 knockout genes. Overall, the IMPC hopes to generate a null mutant and undertake broad-based phenotyping for every gene in the mouse genome. About 30% of these strains are expected to be either embryonic or perinatal lethal, or subviable. However, a large portion of homozygous lethal mutations are expected to have viable heterozygous phenotypes. The scientific community has the unique opportunity to leverage these mouse strains while they are being created and bred as part of the IMPC adult mouse phenotyping effort to perform additional in-depth phenotyping and research.",

Among many other possible endeavors, applicants in response to this FOA could propose demonstrations of how to overcome translational deficiencies of mammalian oncology models, define new uses of mammalian models or their genetics for unexplored translational challenges, advance standard practices for use of translational models, test approaches to validate and credential models, or challenge current practices for how models are used translationally",

A comprehensive understanding of the natural history of a condition is necessary to facilitate appropriate interventions for infants identified by newborn screening. Characterization of the sequence and timing of symptom development provides information crucial for developing targeted, age-appropriate treatments and for establishing a baseline against which to assess novel interventions. In addition, for some conditions, establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations may facilitate prediction of the clinical course; for others, identification of modifying genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors may enhance understanding of clinical outcomes. Comprehensive data on the natural history of a condition will facilitate the fields ability to: 1) identify the underlying biological mechanisms; 2) understand the genetic and clinical heterogeneity and phenotypic expression of the condition; 3) improve diagnostic accuracy; 4) facilitate clinical trials by providing comprehensive natural history data; 5) prevent, manage, and treat symptoms and complications of the condition; 6) furnish physicians and families with needed support and predictive information about the condition; and 7) establish data collection systems or patient registries to collect longitudinal data (e.g., child/family outcomes following newborn screening).",

        "description": "The purpose of this announcement is to encourage investigators to pursue a small clinical trial to obtain critical information necessary to advance recording and/or stimulating devices to treat central nervous system disorders and better understand the human brain (e.g., Early Feasibility Study).  Clinical studies supported may consist of acute or short-term procedures that are deemed Non-Significant Risk (NSR) by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), or Significant Risk (SR) studies that require an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the FDA, such as chronic implants.  The clinical trial should provide data to answer key questions about the function or final design of a device.  This final device design may require most, if not all, of the non-clinical testing on the path to more advanced clinical trials and market approval.  The clinical trial is expected to provide information that cannot be practically obtained through additional non-clinical assessments (e.g., bench top or animal studies) due to the novelty of the device or its intended use. Activities supported by this Funding Opportunity include a small clinical trial to answer key questions about the function or final design of a device.As part of the BRAIN Initiative, NIH has initiated a Public-Private Partnership Program (BRAIN PPP) that includes agreements (Memoranda of Understanding, MOU) with a number of device manufacturers willing to make such devices available, including devices and capabilities not yet market approved but appropriate for clinical research.  In general it is expected that the devices' existing safety and utility data will be sufficient to enable new IRB NSR or FDA IDE approval without need for significant additional non-clinical data.

Large quantities of genomic data collected from pediatric congenital anomalies cohorts are available to the research community through several databases such as the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Portal, the European Genome-Phenome Archive and Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen). The purpose of this initiative is to promote the screening, functional validation and characterization of congenital anomaly-associated genetic variants identified through public facing databases and individual efforts using in-silico tools, appropriate animal models, in vitro systems or multi-pronged approaches. This initiative addresses a challenging gap between identifying sequence variations of potential interest and recognizing which of those variations have functional effects on the phenotype of interest.",

For this NOFO, natural products include promising nutritional regimens that standardize the amount of a specific naturally occurring nutritional compound (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, anthocyanidins, or polyphenols) and have compelling preliminary evidence. Applicants should describe plans for a Clinical Coordinating Center to develop and implement the proposed multi-site clinical trial. The objective of the Clinical Coordinating Center application is to provide the scientific rationale and a comprehensive scientific and operational plan for the clinical trial. Clinical Coordinating Center applications are expected to describe plans for project management, participant recruitment and retention strategies, performance milestones, scientific conduct, and dissemination of results. Clinical Coordinating Center applications submitted under this NOFO will utilize a two-phase, milestone-driven, cooperative agreement (UG3/UH3) funding mechanism.\nIn addition, an accompanying Data Coordinating Center application, submitted under PAR-24-125, proposing a data analysis and data management plan for the clinical project is required. Both a Clinical Coordinating Center application and a corresponding Data Coordinating Center (DCC) application need to be submitted simultaneously for consideration by NCCIH. For additional information about the mission, strategic vision, and research priorities of the NCCIH, applicants are encouraged to consult the NCCIH website: (https://nccih.nih.gov/about/plans).",

Projects that investigate common neurological and/or mental health-related mechanisms across multiple infection-associated chronic illnesses would be of particular interest, although this is not a requirement (i.e., applications can focus on a single condition). Neurologically focused clinical research investigating scientifically compelling pathways that contribute to the development of infection-associated chronic illnesses - including basic experimental studies in humans (BESH) or mechanistic clinical trials that will accelerate the development of effective treatments - are within the scope of this initiative. Preclinical studies utilizing animal, cell culture, and/or human tissue models are also encouraged. All applications must propose such studies in the context of a post-infectious etiology.",

        "description": "The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to solicit applications focused on the neurological and/or mental health-related manifestations of infection-associated chronic illnesses, including the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (Neuro-PASC) as well as other chronic illnesses with a potential infectious trigger (post-treatment Lyme Disease, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome [ME/CFS], postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [POTS], post-viral fatigue syndromes, etc.). Projects that investigate common neurological and/or mental health-related mechanisms across multiple infection-associated chronic illnesses would be of particular interest, although this is not a requirement (i.e., applications can focus on a single condition). Neurologically focused clinical research investigating scientifically compelling pathways that contribute to the development of infection-associated chronic illnesses - including basic experimental studies in humans (BESH) or mechanistic clinical trials that will accelerate the development of effective treatments - are within the scope of this initiative. Preclinical studies utilizing animal, cell culture, and/or human tissue models are also encouraged. All applications must propose such studies in the context of a post-infectious etiology.",

NIOSH is mandated to provide an adequate supply of qualified personnel to carry out the purposes of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the ERCs are one of the primary means for meeting this mandate. ERCs are academic institutions that provide high-quality interdisciplinary graduate and post-graduate training, research training, continuing education, and outreach in the core occupational safety and health disciplines of industrial hygiene, occupational health nursing, occupational medicine, and occupational safety, as well as allied disciplines. Research and research training are integral components of ERCs, with ERC faculty and NIOSH trainees conducting research on issues related to the NIOSH National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) and emerging issues to advance the field of occupational safety and health. NIOSH ERCs have regional presence to further diversify the occupational safety and health profession through their core values, mission statements, and outputs. ERCs serve as resources for our nation's workforce through continuing education, outreach and strong collaboration with professional associations, worker advocacy groups, businesses, industries, and public health agencies. ERCs work with other institutions and organizations, including Minority Serving Institutions and other NIOSH supported training programs to have a positive impact on worker health, safety, and well-being.</p>",

Reagents will be initially developed in pilot resource projects for brain cell type-specific access and manipulation across vertebrate species from the BRAIN Initiative Armamentarium project. Awardees under this NOFO will work with the other Armamentarium awardees to manufacture and distribute the resources for use throughout the neuroscience community. It is envisioned that the awardees will work both with the Armamentarium community as well as with the neuroscience research community to optimize the use of new reagents. The types of reagents to be produced and distributed could include but are not limited to viral vectors, nucleic acid constructs, and nanoparticles designed for selective access to and manipulation of brain cell types. Such reagents will enable neuroscientists to probe circuit function with high precision in experimental animals and ex vivo human tissue and cells. Facilities are needed to contribute to the production and distribution of BRAIN Initiative Armamentarium project reagents broadly to neuroscience users.",

A companion NOFO (RFA-NS-25-017) is targeted to projects focused on optimization of instrumentation and devices that are later in the development cycle, where iterative optimization and end-user testing is needed.&nbsp;The companion NOFO does not allow projects primarily focused on development or optimization of molecular constructs for recording and manipulating neural activity.&nbsp;Projects of this nature are supported by this NOFO and other BRAIN Initiative announcements including RFA-MH-22-245, RFA-MH-21-175, and RFA-EY-21-001 (or their reissue). For this and the companion NOFO, the aim of the proposed technologies should be to reduce major barriers to conducting neurobiological experiments, including considerations of cost and ease of access, and to enable new discoveries for understanding neural circuit function.&nbsp;Technologies should address major challenges associated with recording and modulating CNS activity, at cellular or circuit resolution, and should contribute to an overall ecosystem of technologies spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales in any region throughout the CNS. The approaches should be compatible with experiments in behaving animals, with an expectation that they will be validated with in vivo experiments during the course of the project.&nbsp;Proposed validation experiments must focus on demonstrating the capabilities and potential impact of the technology, rather than advancing the state of biological knowledge as the primary project goal.

Clinical Coordinating Centers (CCC) should develop and implement the proposed fully powered multi-site clinical trial (Phase III and beyond). The objective of a CCC application is to present the scientific rationale and a comprehensive scientific and operational plan for the clinical trial. CCC applications are expected to describe plans for project management, participant recruitment and retention strategies, performance milestones, scientific conduct, and dissemination of results. CCC applications submitted under this NOFO will utilize a two-phase, milestone-driven cooperative agreement (UG3/UH3) funding mechanism. \nIn addition, an accompanying Data Coordinating Center (DCC) application (U24), submitted under PAR-24-087 proposing a data analysis and data management plan for the clinical project is required. Both a CCC application and a corresponding  DCC application need to be submitted simultaneously for consideration by NCCIH. For additional information about the mission, strategic vision, and research priorities of  NCCIH, applicants are encouraged to consult the NCCIH website: (https://nccih.nih.gov/about/plans). \nApplicants are encouraged to contact the appropriate Scientific/Research contact for the area of science for which they are planning to develop an application prior to submitting to this NOFO.",

Close collaboration and networking among programs and regional networks and relevant partners is critical as the globe faces new and re-emerging public health threats. The recent outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola and other diseases clearly demonstrate the need for strong country, regional, and global programs that can work together, collaborate, and share resources. Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP) are proven to be critical part of the workforce needed to detect and respond to disease. There is also a need to identify other workforce development programs that contribute to this end. Networking among these programs and regional FETP networks needs to be supported through training, scientific conferences, and meetings, establishing standards, monitoring and evaluation, and strong communication. Awardees will work and collaborate with CDC and other partners to assess PHW needs, develop plans to fill gaps and strengthen existing programs such as the FETP, , develop standards for accreditation and credentialing and assist countries when and where needed.",

        "description": "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) supports research projects that address the following broad research areas: (1) Physical and mental health conditions that may be related to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; (2) Diagnosing WTC-related health conditions for which there has been diagnostic uncertainty; and (3) Treating WTC-related health conditions for which there has been treatment uncertainty. These broad research areas can include health conditions which have emerged over the course of time since the treatment program started (or the WTC Health Program was created). WTC responders, screening-eligible WTC survivors, and certified-eligible WTC survivors comprise the relevant populations of concern for research supported by the WTC Health Program. The purpose of this announcement is to increase opportunities for research on emerging conditions identified by WTC Health Program surveillance and research activities as requiring further program consideration. Generally, NIOSH is seeking more information from research on the potential for a causal relationship between 9/11 exposures and specific emerging health conditions that are not presently listed as WTC-related conditions. An ‘emerging’ condition is one in which preliminary data on a 9/11-exposed population are suggestive of, but inconclusive on, a causal relationship between 9/11 exposure and the health condition. Examples are ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease (hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke), dementia, Parkinson disease, peripheral neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, among others. Examples can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/received.html in the section titled, Petitions Received and WTC Health Program Responses. Additional information on petitions is available in the following publication \"The World Trade Center Health Program: Petitions for adding qualifying health conditions\" (Am J Ind Med 64(10): 885-892). Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaborations that share expertise are essential to advance WTC Health Program efforts to support activities to address emerging WTC Health Program health and well-being priorities. The research should consider health equity initiatives in design, where possible. Opportunities for future health effects research involving vulnerable groups of persons (e.g., minorities, women, children, and other potentially disadvantaged groups) who were exposed to the 9/11 attacks and aftermath are of special interest. Research is needed to identify at-risk groups, characterize the health burden, and to inform care. The WTC Health Program Research webpage provides comprehensive information and tools for researchers. The research agenda, publication library, and other resources, including the Funding Dashboard, can also be found there (e.g., awarded project details such as publications, topics, populations, funding awarded, and the principal investigators and their institutions).",

WTC responders, screening-eligible WTC survivors, and certified-eligible WTC survivors comprise the relevant populations of concern for research supported by the WTC Health Program. The purpose of this announcement is to solicit meritorious and scientifically rigorous research applications that will help: 1) improve diagnosis and treatment activities of the WTC Health Program; 2) expand knowledge about health effects related to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks; 3) answer critical questions about physical and mental health conditions related to the September 2001 terrorist attacks; and 4) apply lessons learned from 9/11 to improve response to future disasters. Clinical research areas considered for potential projects may include, but are not limited to: (a) Screening research to evaluate current, or facilitate the development of, new/improved methods to detect certain disorders or health conditions.; (b) Diagnostic research to evaluate current, or facilitate the development of, new/improved, methods to identify diseases, disorders, or conditions; c) Treatment research to evaluate/identify improved treatment interventions/methods (e.g., medication, psychotherapy, dietary/nutritional, care management and coordination etc.) or promote the development of new or novel treatment approaches, e.g. telemedicine; (d) Prevention research to identify/evaluate new methods and interventions (e.g., medicine(s), psychotherapy, vaccines, nutrition, or lifestyle changes) that prevent or mitigate the development or reoccurrence of various diseases/disorders; (e) Quality of Life research to identify, develop, or evaluate, methods/interventions that improve comfort and the quality of life for individuals with a chronic illness or multimorbidity; (f) Omics research to facilitate improvement in methods/procedures for the prediction of disorders by identifying and understanding how genes and illnesses may be related (e.g., identification of phenotypes and biomarkers). Research in this area may explore ways in which a person’s genes make him or her more or less likely to develop a disorder or respond to a medication; (g) Epidemiological/clinical research to identify patterns, causes, and control of adverse health effects among the 9/11-exposed population, including research focusing on potentially vulnerable or understudied populations, such as women, race and ethnic minority groups, and persons who were exposed to 9/11 hazards as children. These projects will also identify, implement and improve research methods; (h) Health Services research to examine how people get access to health care and care management services, how much care costs, and what happens to patients because of this care. Research projects in this area have the potential to identify improved methods/procedures to organize, manage, finance, and deliver health care; and (i) Implementation research to evaluate the process whereby WTC Health Program research outputs are disseminated, adopted, implemented, sustained, and scaled up equitably in real-world settings for affected populations. Relevant physical and mental health conditions include, but are not limited to: aerodigestive health; aging (the impacts of aging on those impacted by 9/11 illness and injury (e.g., premature aging, optimizing adaptation for productivity)); cancer (including detection/diagnosis of pre-malignant changes); cardiovascular disease; cognitive changes; neurological diseases; multisystem or auto-immune diseases; persistent psychiatric conditions such as posttraumatic stress, anxiety and depressive disorders; and psychological resilience.

Phenotypes associated with addictive behaviors and/or vulnerability to distinct stages along the substance use disorders (SUD) trajectory (e.g. initial/acute use, escalation of use, acquisition of tolerance, dependence, uncontrolled use, abstinence and relapse or recovery); 2. Behaviors associated with SUD (e.g. impulsivity, novelty seeking, delayed discounting, and other genetically-associated phenotypes); and 3. Comorbidities that demonstrate genetic correlations with phenotypes and behaviors linked with SUD (e.g. anxiety, stress, poor maternal care, social defeat, and other paradigms). Applications may examine any type of genomic variant, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, large and small structural variants, and all types of mobile DNA. NIDA encourages applications that take genomics, multi-omics, and/or data-based approaches that integrate multi-level omics data, delineate gene networks, and/or uncover the function of known or newly discovered genetic or epigenetic variants. Other areas of interest include genomics analysis at the circuit level and the application of neuroscience to genomics studies. NIDA expects these studies to uncover novel mechanisms that contribute to various stages across the SUD trajectory and inform future studies about potential targets and therapeutic strategies for addiction.",

There are three components in the NOFO that address other parasitic infections, they are: Chagas disease, soil-transmitted helminths, and other parasitic diseases of domestic concern. This NOFO will continue the work of the Parasitic Disease Branch in CDC’s National Center for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases to strengthen health care providers’ understanding, identification, treatment and prevention of parasitic infections in the U.S. Component A of this NOFO will focus on using existing data to develop and disseminate strategies, educational tools, materials, and guidelines related to Chagas disease diagnosis and management in the United States to: improve healthcare provider knowledge and practices, increase testing and improve management of persons with or at risk of infection with the parasite that causes Chagas disease, increase awareness, availability and use of best practices, education training tools and materials. Component B will focus on expanding the ongoing public health surveillance and disease control activities receiving congressional funding to investigate and address infections with soil transmitted helminths (including strongyloidiasis) across the Southeast United States (southern states included in the South region as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where these infections have historically been endemic through testing, treatment and health education. Component C will focus on prevention and control of other parasitic diseases of domestic concern that have public health significance (for example, cyclosporiasis, echinococcosis, leishmaniasis, and toxoplasmosis). Proposals involving malaria, cryptosporidiosis, or giardiasis or those specifying international activities will not be considered. Successful strategies should have the potential to yield high impact public health outcomes, reach a high proportion of those at risk, and have the highest potential for significant impact on population health.",

A parallel forecast is posted under AH-TPS-25-001. The funding level and eligibility described in each forecast is specific to that programs requirements. This forecast is for the Title X component. A single notice of funding opportunity will be posted with the details for both.A single application will be required covering PA-FPT-25-001 and AH-TSP-25-001. The application must be submitted under the PA-FPT-25-001 announcement in Grants.gov. The application will consist of 2 distinct parts; one for each program contributing to this opportunity.  To receive funding from the Title X program, you must be a public or private non-profit entity.  To receive funding from the TPP program, you must be a public or private (non-profit or for-profit) entity.  Two or more entities may work together to achieve eligibility for both programs. For example, a private non-profit and a private for-profit could apply as a legally recognized non-profit partnership or consortium that is registered in SAM.gov. Entities wishing to apply jointly without forming a legally recognized relationship should contact OASH_Grants@hhs.gov for instructions on how to prepare an application that will not be disqualified on eligibility grounds as soon as possible. At the time of application, both entities be able to demonstrate an ability to carry out the project together as separate entities, including any conflict resolution, over the entire expected period of performance.        Only one applicant will be funded.  We intend to award the project using 2 cooperative agreements (one funded under Title X and one funded under the Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Program). Together the two cooperative agreements together will constitute the National Training Center. Up to $3.5 M is available to address Title X key priority areas (CFDA 93.260) andUp to $1.5 M is available to address TPP key priority areas (CFDA 93.297).     For the Title X program - The goal of the funded training center is to ensure that personnel working in Title X have the knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy necessary to effectively run a Title X grant program and deliver high-quality family planning services.The funded training center will provide training and technical assistance for the Title X family planning service grantees focused on:Ensuring access to and implementation of high quality service delivery;Building capacity of the Title X workforce;Strengthening health information and technology; andBuilding financial sustainability.For the TPP Program - The goal of the funded training center is to ensure that personnel working on TPP-funded projects have the knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy necessary to effectively run a TPP funded project to make the greatest impact on communities.The funded training center will provide training and technical assistance for the TPP recipients focused on:Program design, implementation, and evaluation;Building the capacity of TPP project staff to effectively meet the goals of their TPP project;Engagement of key stakeholders in addressing teen pregnancy prevention in their communitiesBest practices in continuous quality improvement and evaluationCommunication, dissemination, and sustainability.We typically fund awards in 12-month budget periods. We may approve shorter budget periods or periods of performance to accommodate administrative factors or funding constraints. For multi-year projects, recipients must submit a non-competing continuation (NCC) application for each budget period after the first. Continuation funding is contingent upon the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the project, appropriate stewardship of federal funds, and the best interests of the government. Funding for all approved budget periods after the first is generally the same as the initial award amount subject to any offset with funds unused in the previous budget period.",

        "description": "We anticipate offering this opportunity in combination with AH-TPS-25-001 to operate a National Training Center that will provide training and technical assistance to all OPA-funded Title X family planning service delivery grantees and all OPA-funded Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Program recipients.  A parallel forecast is posted under AH-TPS-25-001. The funding level and eligibility described in each forecast is specific to that programs requirements. This forecast is for the Title X component. A single notice of funding opportunity will be posted with the details for both. A single application will be required covering PA-FPT-25-001 and AH-TSP-25-001. The application must be submitted under the PA-FPT-25-001 announcement in Grants.gov. The application will consist of 2 distinct parts; one for each program contributing to this opportunity.  To receive funding from the Title X program, you must be a public or private non-profit entity.  To receive funding from the TPP program, you must be a public or private (non-profit or for-profit) entity.  Two or more entities may work together to achieve eligibility for both programs. For example, a private non-profit and a private for-profit could apply as a legally recognized non-profit partnership or consortium that is registered in SAM.gov. Entities wishing to apply jointly without forming a legally recognized relationship should contact OASH_Grants@hhs.gov for instructions on how to prepare an application that will not be disqualified on eligibility grounds as soon as possible. At the time of application, both entities be able to demonstrate an ability to carry out the project together as separate entities, including any conflict resolution, over the entire expected period of performance.       Only one applicant will be funded.  We intend to award the project using 2 cooperative agreements (one funded under Title X and one funded under the Teen Pregnancy Prevention (TPP) Program). Together the two cooperative agreements together will constitute the National Training Center.Up to $3.5 M is available to address Title X key priority areas (CFDA 93.260) andUp to $1.5 M is available to address TPP key priority areas (CFDA 93.297).     For the Title X program - The goal of the funded training center is to ensure that personnel working in Title X have the knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy necessary to effectively run a Title X grant program and deliver high-quality family planning services.The funded training center will provide training and technical assistance for the Title X family planning service grantees focused on:Ensuring access to and implementation of high quality service delivery;Building capacity of the Title X workforce;Strengthening health information and technology; andBuilding financial sustainability.For the TPP Program - The goal of the funded training center is to ensure that personnel working on TPP-funded projects have the knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy necessary to effectively run a TPP funded project to make the greatest impact on communities.The funded training center will provide training and technical assistance for the TPP recipients focused on:Program design, implementation, and evaluation;Building the capacity of TPP project staff to effectively meet the goals of their TPP project;Engagement of key stakeholders in addressing teen pregnancy prevention in their communitiesBest practices in continuous quality improvement and evaluationCommunication, dissemination, and sustainability.We typically fund awards in 12-month budget periods. We may approve shorter budget periods or periods of performance to accommodate administrative factors or funding constraints. For multi-year projects, recipients must submit a non-competing continuation (NCC) application for each budget period after the first. Continuation funding is contingent upon the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the project, appropriate stewardship of federal funds, and the best interests of the government. Funding for all approved budget periods after the first is generally the same as the initial award amount subject to any offset with funds unused in the previous budget period.",

        "description": "Projects proposed under the Wilson Fish TANF Coordination Program (WF TCP) will identify service gaps in TANF- or other state-funded, ORR- or State Department-funded, and community-wide programming currently serving TANF-type families with the purpose of developing and providing in-person and remote services and/or resources that will enhance or complement that programming to address unmet needs of refugee families. ORR defines “TANF-type” as single- or two-parent ORR-eligible families with children under the age of 18. Applicants will demonstrate that proposed projects will fill an identified gap within existing services and programming and will not duplicate existing services and programming. ORR encourages applicants to examine services to clients in geographically remote areas of the state, families with members who may not have access to in-person services, and populations without access to other ORR-funded services, among others, as they identify barriers to families’ pursuit of self-sufficiency, community integration, and social adjustment. Examples of such services and resources include, but are not limited to: enhanced case management; referrals to refugee-specific or mainstream English language and social services; the use of community liaisons and navigators to navigate benefits systems; employment services; digital and financial literacy education; enhanced cultural and community orientation programming; transportation and childcare access; and the development of information in languages commonly spoken within resettled refugee communities. The WF TC program requires award recipients’ coordination with the subdivision of the state agency tasked with the operation of the state's TANF program (or \"state TANF office\") and the office of the SRC, as well as the development or fostering of partnerships with other stakeholders, including other mainstream benefit and service providers.",

The lessons generated from these endeavors will be deployed to achieve the current initiative’s primary aim to accelerate nation-wide implementation of SMBP (self-measured blood pressure) during pregnancy and postpartum. SMBP is a best practice defined as the regular measurement of blood pressure by the patient at home or other setting with clinical support. Based on a large body of evidence, SMBP is recommended in both national and international guidelines for the detection and control of HTN in adults and its use postpartum by AHRQ’s Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Management of Postpartum Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy.This initiative is intended to serve as the catalyst to drive towards making SMBP a common and routine practice during pregnancy and postpartum.  With a special focus on underserved and rural communities, including maternity care deserts, the initiative seeks equitable detection and control of HTN, improved maternal and fetal outcomes, and reductions in admissions and morbidity from HTN-related complications.Applicants will need to demonstrate that they will be able to fully implement their projects within the first six months of the award. Recipients will be expected to evaluate processes and outcomes throughout the project to assess project effectiveness and impact over the period of performance.Over the course of the project, recipients will be expected to document and share project findings and results (e.g., data, best practices, lessons learned) with HHS and others interested in SMBP utilization during pregnancy and postpartum.We expect to fund awards in 12-month budget periods for a total period of performance up to 24 months.

Demonstration projects are time-limited projects for the purpose of assessing the effectiveness of an approach or intervention toward reaching a desired outcome. We expect award recipients under this opportunity to consider approaches to sustainability beyond the end of the support provided by OMH.     Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is self-reported confusion or memory loss and an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Groups disproportionately affected by dementia and related chronic illnesses may face barriers to health care and social services that increase their risk of poor health outcomes. Projects funded under the initiative will use novel community-based strategies that address social determinants of health (SDOH) and risk factors in the environments where people live, work, learn play and worship. We intend for projects to reduce health disparities and demonstrate progress towards SCD-related Healthy People 2030 objectives. See https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/dementias for more information.

Sponsored projects will identify, collect, analyze, and use early childhood data to complete research activities guiding policy and program improvement efforts. Specifically, projects will explore: (1) questions of interest to local tribal communities and ACF to investigate tribal child care policies and practices; (2) data sources available to answer questions of interest and assess the accessibility of those data; (3) possible data sources from other tribal and local data systems for linking; and (4) the barriers and opportunities to collecting, analyzing, and using data to inform tribal child care policy decisions and CCDF administrative practices.Activities under the planning grants include development of a plan for identifying, linking, and using tribal early childhood data to inform child care policy decisions, as well as a plan for sharing and disseminating information with partnering agencies and organizations. The awards would be 18-month grants, with one (1) 18-month budget period (i.e., September 2025 – March 2027). These awards would fund the development of a data and research plan under a planning phase a to address questions of interest to the Tribal CCDF Lead Agency. These planning grants may be followed by a second competition (Phase II), under a separate Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) to support execution of the data and research plans to develop and improve state/territory data systems and conduct research to inform priorities for the Tribal organizations and populations. Sponsored projects will be expected to participate in a consortium that will meet and communicate regularly to identify opportunities for coordination, such as to share facilitators and barriers to identifying and using early childhood data and methods for linking data across systems, and to develop collective expertise and resources for the field. The consortium’s collaboration will support research capacity and learning within individual projects and across grantees.

The TRC is expected to: (1) serve as a hub for strategically disseminating information and facilitating peer exchange on culturally responsive research, evaluation, and measurement of early childhood programs and family economic well-being initiatives in Indigenous communities; (2) identify and disseminate information on the validity of existing measures of culturally meaningful inputs, implementation processes, and outcomes of shared interest across TRC program areas; (3) further explore, test the validity,  and increase the usefulness and adoption within practice settings of culturally grounded measures of shared interest across TRC program areas; (4) engage in and facilitate secondary analyses of extant data from across TRC program areas (e.g., administrative data, accessible national datasets) to better understand community characteristics, implementation processes, and outcomes; (5) provide training and professional development to promote interest and competencies in culturally responsive and actionable research, evaluation, and measurement relevant to early childhood programs and family economic well-being initiatives in Indigenous communities. The TRC will bring together a team with expertise in each of the TRC program areas and will be equipped to engage local Indigenous program administrators and staff and federal staff across all TRC program areas.

        "description": "The Prevention Services Evaluation Partnerships: Supporting Adoptive Families funding opportunity supports research (summative randomized control trial or quasi-experimental evaluation) to evaluate programs that help adoptive families at risk of disruption or dissolution that may result in foster care placements. This funding opportunity focuses on partnerships between researchers, Title IV-E agencies, and community entities with experience working with adopted children, foster children or children in kinship care. The evaluation will focus on mental health, substance abuse prevention and treatment, in-home parent skill-based, or kinship navigator programs or services. The award recipient must conduct a randomized control trial or a similar evaluation that meets the Title IV-E Prevention Services Clearinghouse (the Clearinghouse) Design and Execution Standards for Moderate or High Support of Causal Evidence. To be considered eligible, the program or service being evaluated must already be prepared for rigorous research, such as having completed earlier evaluations. The recipient can gather and analyze new data or use existing data for the proposed evaluation. ACF is especially interested in evaluations of programs or services that are eligible for review by the Clearinghouse but are not yet rated, or those rated as \"does not currently meet criteria\". The award recipient must also work closely with federal staff and the current PSEP cohort throughout the evaluation. This funding opportunity is planned to have a four-year project period with one budget period. For further information about OPRE, see https://www.acf.hhs.gov/opre.",

Relevant communities must be actively and meaningfully involved on ELSI research teams across all phases of proposed research projects. Research capacity building plans must be informed by a needs assessment. Given the complex structure, a strategic management plan, evaluation plan, and sustainability plan are required to ensure successful completion of the program.",

To accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this NOFO will support educational activities with a primary focus on: (1) Research Experiences, (2) Curriculum or Methods Development and (3) Outreach. The NCI’s mission is to conduct and support research, training, health information dissemination, and other programs concerning cancer. This funding opportunity seeks to facilitate educational activities that encourage students to become knowledgeable about cancer and available to focus on cancer later in their careers.&nbsp;To promote broad interest&nbsp;in pursuing a career in biomedical research via early intervention strategies, the NCI Youth Enjoy Science (YES) Program will support efforts to create and maintain an institutional program to engage grades 6-12 and/or undergraduate students in cutting edge cancer research experiences. The proposed institutional programs may also provide research experiences for the grade 6-12 teachers and undergraduate faculty members. The goals are to inspire interest in biomedical sciences, help envision research as a career path, and strengthen practical research and career skills. In alignment with these goals, institutions may develop unique programs that capitalize on their research strengths and are responsive to their target populations.</p>",

        "description": "Lupus is a systemic autoimmune disease. It is estimated 161,000 to 322,000 Americans have the most common type of lupus, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although anyone can get lupus, 9 out of 10 diagnoses of lupus are in women ages 15 to 44. African American and Latino women are at greater risk for lupus than white women and usually get it at a younger age and have more severe symptoms. Lupus is also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American and Alaskan Native women. The causes of lupus are unknown but are believed to be linked to genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors.Lupus is difficult to diagnose, hard to live with and challenging to treat. Lupus has a range of symptoms often confused with other conditions, making it difficult to recognize and diagnose. Its symptoms and outcomes can be severe or fatal, its onset can be sudden, its causes are unclear and there is no known cure.This NOFO addresses several persisting gaps and inequities related to lupus. Lupus can result in a range of negative outcomes including disability, social stigma, lost productivity, absence from the workforce, reduction in quality of life, organ damage or failure or early death. Undiagnosed or late diagnosis of lupus can increase the likelihood or worsen the severity of many of these outcomes. Even with a correct diagnosis, lupus is challenging to treat. Much is needed to improve the care and quality of life for people living with the disease. The public health sector can contribute a great deal to this end and help mitigate these gaps and inequities.The purpose of the NOFO is to support national organizations implementing national efforts to help reduce time to lupus diagnoses, increase number of people with lupus getting needed care and ongoing treatment, improve lupus care, care transition and care coordination, improve lupus patients’ self-management behaviors, and improve quality of life and health outcomes among people with lupus. This NOFO will focus on two key strategies and their associated activities:Strategy A: Increase awareness, knowledge and skills among healthcare providers to appropriately recognize the signs and symptoms of lupus, what to do if lupus is suspected, and provide quality, well-coordinated lupus care. Activities are to:Develop and promote healthcare provider lupus training and education.Increase the role of technology in the clinical setting.Collaborate with health professional associations to establish or increase sustainable educational opportunities.Develop and promote practice procedures for transition of lupus care from pediatric to adult care.Strategy B: In collaboration with key stakeholders promote the national uptake and use of effective lupus self-management tools and/or services. Activities are to:Raise awareness about lupus signs and symptoms and what to do if you have lupus among targeted populations using existing national lupus campaigns, websites, and tools.Support implementation and evaluation of lupus-specific self-management tools and/or services.Promote the national uptake and use of lupus self-management tools and/or services among women ages 15 to 44 and key stakeholders.Apply electronic health or medical record systems or other medical information technology to refer patients to appropriate lupus self-management tools/services, and track patient information.Identify and address lupus patients’ barriers to access effective lupus self-management tools and/or services.These strategies and activities are intended to result in the following outcomes:Increased number of healthcare providers recognizing the signs and symptoms of lupus and what to do if lupus is suspected.Increased number of healthcare providers using tele-health and/or electronic health records to identify lupus cases and treatment gaps.Increased number of settings receiving guidance on transition of pediatric lupus care to adult care.Increased number of people living with lupus engaged in the use of lupus self-management tools and/or services.Increased number of referrals to lupus self-management tools and/or services using electronic health or medical record systems or other medical information technology.Improved self-management behaviors among people with lupus.The NOFO will fund TWO awards, ONE award will be issued for each Strategy. Applicant can apply for one or both Strategies but must submit a separate application for each Strategy. A total of $3,500,000 is available for annual funding, a range of $1.4 Million to $1.8 Million will be awarded to each successful applicant.",

These SDOH include the five National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) quality of life indicators: self-reported good or better health, unmet need for mental health services, employment, hunger/food insecurity, and homelessness and unstable housing. Organizations will be funded to offer integrated care service models that provide HIV care and treatment and other health care and essential support services to women with HIV (WWH) through Community and Clinic Collaboratives (CCCs). CCCs will be comprised of clinics and federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), community-based organizations (CBOs), and local and state health departments (HDs) serving women in areas in the South with high HIV disease burden. CCCs will screen, navigate and link WWH to comprehensive and integrated health services including chronic disease care, pre-and post-natal care, primary care, pediatric care, and aging-related services. Recipients will be funded to implement four strategies: (1) Offer comprehensive and integrated models of care that provide HIV care and treatment and other health care services to WWH through CCCs; (2) Offer whole person health screening, navigation and linkage to STI, behavioral health (mental health and substance use disorders) and other subsistence and essential support services, as needed, to WWH and referrals for screening, navigation and linkage services for women at risk for HIV via CCCs; (3) Provide services that are culturally and linguistically responsive for women and address stigma and medical mistrust; and (4) Participate in a national learning collaborative to share best practices and lessons learned for comprehensive HIV and other services for WWH. Key outcomes of the project include an increased number of WWH who initiate rapid ART, are virally suppressed, and have met needs for services for mental health and substance use disorders and other essential support services.",

        "description": "The purpose of the NHLBI Outstanding Investigator Award (OIA) is to promote scientific productivity and innovation by providing long-term support and increased flexibility to experienced Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PDs/PIs) who are currently PDs/PIs on at least two NHLBI R01-equivalent awards and whose outstanding record of research demonstrates their ability to make major contributions to heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) research. The OIA is intended to support a research program, rather than a research project, by providing the primary and most likely sole source of NHLBI funding on individual grant awards.\nThe OIA will support the research program of NHLBI-funded investigators for up to seven years. The OIA will provide investigators increased freedom to conduct research that breaks new ground or extends previous discoveries in new directions. It will also allow PDs/PIs to take greater risks and to pursue research that requires a longer timeframe. Research supported by the OIA must be within the scope of the NHLBI mission (https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/mission-statement).\nIt is anticipated that the OIA will:\nProvide a stable funding environment, thereby improving productivity and facilitating nimble, ambitious, creative research;\nAccelerate scientific innovation by enabling flexibility in pursuing new research directions as they arise, since PDs/PIs will not be bound to specific aims proposed in advance of the studies;\nReduce the time researchers spend writing grant applications and managing multiple grant awards, thereby allowing more time to be devoted to conducting research;\nFacilitate commitment of PDs/PIs to research through increased stability of funding; and\nEnable PDs/PIs to devote more time and energy to mentoring students and junior scientists and providing scientific service.",

        "description": "The purpose of the NHLBI Emerging Investigator Award (EIA) is to promote scientific productivity and innovation by providing long-term support and increased flexibility to experienced Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PDs/PIs) who are currently PDs/PIs on at least two NHLBI R01-equivalent awards and whose outstanding record of research demonstrates their ability to make major contributions to heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) research.\nThe EIA is intended to support a research program, rather than a research project, by providing the primary and most likely sole source of NHLBI funding on individual grant awards. The EIA will support the research program of NHLBI-funded investigators for up to seven years. The EIA will provide investigators increased freedom to conduct research that breaks new ground or extends previous discoveries in new directions. It will also allow PDs/PIs to take greater risks and to pursue research that requires a longer timeframe. Research supported by the EIA must be within the scope of the NHLBI mission (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/org/mission).",

Each independent scientist career award program must be tailored to meet the individual needs of the candidate.This Parent Funding Opportunity Announcement is for basic science experimental studies involving humans, referred to in NOT-OD-18-212 as prospective basic science studies involving human participants.  These studies fall within the NIH definition of a clinical trial and also meet the definition of basic research.  Types of studies that should be submitted under this FOA include studies that prospectively assign human participants to conditions (i.e., experimentally manipulate independent variables) and that assess biomedical or behavioral outcomes in humans for the purpose of understanding the fundamental aspects of phenomena without specific application towards processes or products in mind. Applicants not planning an independent clinical trial or basic experimental study with humans, or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial or basic experimental study with humans led by another investigator, must apply to the 'Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed' companion FOA. The proposed project must be related to the programmatic interests of one or more of the participating NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs)  based on their scientific missions.",

The research experiences will prepare clinicians to successfully compete for individual NIH mentored career development awards, or where appropriate,  independent research awards.  This FOA will also support educational activities such that participants of the R25 are expected to attend and participate in an annual workshop specific to this FOA to present their work, discuss progress and plans towards transitioning to the next career stage and to network with other researchers and leaders in their fields.  Such success will facilitate their transition from resident/fellow to physician-scientist, and will thus foster retention of a cadre of physician-scientists who will conduct research into the mechanisms of, etiology, and treatment of neurological diseases.",

For this NOFO, natural products include promising nutritional regimens that standardize the amount of a specific naturally occurring nutritional compound (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, anthocyanidins, or polyphenols) and have compelling preliminary evidence. Applicants should describe plans for a Clinical Coordinating Center to develop and implement the proposed multi-site clinical trial. The objective of the Clinical Coordinating Center application is to provide the scientific rationale and a comprehensive scientific and operational plan for the clinical trial. Clinical Coordinating Center applications are expected to describe plans for project management, participant recruitment and retention strategies, performance milestones, scientific conduct, and dissemination of results. Clinical Coordinating Center applications submitted under this NOFO will utilize a two-phase, milestone-driven, cooperative agreement (UG3/UH3) funding mechanism.In addition, an accompanying Data Coordinating Center application, submitted under PAR-20-219, proposing a data analysis and data management plan for the clinical project is required. Both a Clinical Coordinating Center application and a corresponding Data Coordinating Center (DCC) application need to be submitted simultaneously for consideration by NCCIH. For additional information about the mission, strategic vision, and research priorities of the NCCIH, applicants are encouraged to consult the NCCIH website: (https://nccih.nih.gov/about/plans).</p>",

Tools developed in this research can also be applied to other similar GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs specifically, and other siRNAs in general. Knowledge gained from this research will also contribute to the sameness evaluation of generic siRNAs, and to the quality control of oligonucleotide drugs.&nbsp;</span></p>",

        "description": "<p>The objective of this research proposal is to develop physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model-based mechanistic in vitro in vivo correlations (IVIVCs) for two major types of long acting injectables (LAIs) such as crystalline suspensions and polymer-based implants by considering their distinct characteristics. The goal of the project is to develop a bottom-up mechanistic PBPK model for these two LAI categories by accounting for the influence of critical formulation attributes of each LAI drug product type to predict its in vivo release mechanism. The model formulation parameters and relevant physiology should be informed with suitable in vitro and in vivo experiments. A suitable preclinical animal model can be used to validate the PBPK model based IVIVCs for both LAI suspensions and polymer based implants.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: black;\">The use of PBPK modelling provides a unique opportunity to understand how the physicochemical properties of drug molecules/polymer, implant specific properties, critical formulation attributes, and physiology, among other things, influence the in vivo release mechanisms of LAI drug products and their disposition characteristics. Moreover, once developed, a mechanistic PBPK model can help to define the 'safe space' for critical formulation attributes relevant to the reference listed drug (RLD) product, explain sources of PK variability and extrapolate predictions to human subjects by leveraging animal model data and by accounting for species-specific physiological differences.</span></p>",

This FOA requires a minimum of three interrelated research projects that investigate a complex biomedical theme or research question. The projects may be supported by core units, if justified, to facilitate economy of effort, space, and equipment. The NHLBI provides support for Program Project Grants (PPGs) in the belief that collaborative research efforts can accelerate the acquisition of knowledge more effectively than a simple aggregate of research projects that have no interaction or thematic integration. NHLBI is particularly interested in encouraging new scientific directions in PPGs. Use of the P01 activity code is viewed as an opportunity to attract scientists who have not traditionally been supported by the NHLBI. Further, the PPG environment presents an opportunity for emerging scientific leaders to gain insight into how to lead a successful scientific Program, and applicants will have the opportunity to include a project led by an Early Stage Investigator (ESI). All projects in the Program must be interrelated and have objectives that address a central theme within the scientific mandate of the NHLBI.",

However, despite the advances in the power of modern computers, there are still some bottlenecks in using CFD due to computational time, limited grid resolution, pre- and post-processing of large simulation data sets, model parameter estimations, and uncertainty quantifications. Machine learning (ML) has been gaining more attention as a potential tool to alleviate such limitations that arise in CFD. The purpose of this grant is to develop a methodology to integrate ML with CFD models of OIDPs to promote alternative BE studies to enhance and accelerate the development and approval of generic OIDPs.&nbsp;</span></p>",

        "description": "<p>Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to accelerate the adoption and validation of molecular/cellular/imaging markers (referred to as \"markers\" or \"biomarkers\") and assays for cancer detection, diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and prediction of response or resistance to treatment, as well as markers for cancer prevention and control. This NOFO will also support the validation of pharmacodynamic markers and markers of toxicity. Applicants to this NOFO must have an assay(s) whose performance has been analytically validated in specimens similar to those for the intended clinical use of the marker(s) and assay(s). As chemotherapies and/or radiation therapies are increasingly combined with immunotherapies to enhance the durability of anti-cancer responses, assays for measuring multiple markers, including immune markers, can be developed and validated simultaneously.The UH3 mechanism will support the clinical validation of established assays for up to 3 years using specimens from retrospective or prospective clinical trials or studies. This NOFO may be used to validate existing assays for use in other trials, observational studies, or population studies. Efforts to harmonize clinical laboratory tests, including investigation into the performance and reproducibility of assays across multiple clinical laboratories, are also appropriate for this funding opportunity. Projects proposed for this NOFO will require multi-disciplinary interaction and collaboration among scientific investigators, oncologists, statisticians, and clinical laboratory scientists. This NOFO is not intended to support early-stage development of technology or the conduct of clinical trials but is intended for validation of assays to the point where they could be integrated into clinical trials/studies as investigational assays.</p>",

The program will fund P50 SPORE grants to support state-of-the-art investigator-initiated translational research that will contribute to improved prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of an organ-specific cancer or a highly related group of cancers. For the purpose of this FOA, a group of highly related cancers are those that are derived from the same organ system, such as gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine, head and neck, and other cancers. Other programmatically appropriate groups of cancers may include those centered around a common biological mechanism critical for promoting tumorigenesis and/or cancer progression in organ sites that belong to different organ systems. For example, a SPORE may focus on cancers caused by the same infectious agent or cancers promoted and sustained by dysregulation of a common signaling pathway. In addition, a SPORE may focus on cross-cutting themes such as pediatric cancers or cancer health disparities. The research supported through this program must be translational and must stem from research on human biology using cellular, molecular, structural, biochemical, and/or genetic experimental approaches. SPORE projects must have the goal of reaching a translational human endpoint within the project period of the grant.",

Centers should emphasize the creation and implementation of evidence-based solutions that address important construction industry safety and health problems. Collaborations with other academic institutions, nonprofit organizations, and other occupational safety and health-focused groups are expected. Applicants must concisely describe the occupational health burden of important safety and health issues in the construction industry and discuss how focused research and outreach activities will help alleviate the burden and reduce numbers. Applicants should also clearly articulate the anticipated impacts of the Center’s proposed work, both during the project period and beyond.</p>",

Research and mentorship must be in the field of HIV/AIDS translational studies, using nonhuman primates (NHPs) as preclinical models. These awards will provide 3 years of support for intensive research career development under the guidance of an experienced mentorship team, with expertise in both the pre-clinical application of NHP HIV/AIDS models and in translation of the results from such studies to clinical application in humans. The expectation is that this sustained experience will launch independent research careers and enable awardees to become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., R01) funding. This funding initiative addresses research priorities of the fiscal year (FY) 2021-2025 NIH Strategic Plan for HIV and HIV-Related Research (https://www.oar.nih.gov/hiv-policy-and-research/strategic-plan): reduce the incidence of HIV; develop next-generation HIV therapies; research toward HIV cure; and address HIV-associated comorbidities, coinfections, and complications.\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is designed specifically for candidates proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary study to a clinical trial. Applicants to this FOA are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. Those proposing a clinical trial or an ancillary clinical trial as lead investigator, should apply to the companion FOA (FOA #).",

        "description": "The goals of this program are to support locally relevant research in critical areas of HIV-associated non-communicable diseases (NCDs) at Low- and Middle-Income Country (LMIC) Institutions, to enhance research capacity, and build a network of researchers both within and across LMICs to address this critical burden. This initiative is expected to stimulate new research on the interplay between HIV and development of NCDs in persons living with HIV (PLWH), including exploratory studies to uncover the extent to which HIV infection influences the etiopathogenesis of the NCDs; and to identify and develop appropriate approaches for effective diagnosis, prevention, therapeutic interventions and integrated clinical care for PLWH with the comorbid conditions. Applicants should develop their studies in keeping with the NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities ( https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-018.html; https://www.oar.nih.gov/hiv-policy-and-research/research-priorities). Research teams should contain an appropriate mix of expertise to accomplish the proposed studies, including partnerships between HIV and NCD researchers who can initiate new ideas and determine feasibility of novel approaches to understand and reduce the long-term suffering from the comorbid disorders. Applicants will also be asked to address the needs of collaborating LMIC institutions to develop capacity for carrying out research in this field. U.S. and LMIC investigators are eligible to apply for collaborative projects to be done at LMIC sites; however, a U.S. investigator must apply together with an LMIC investigator. LMICs are defined by the World Bank classification system according to Gross National Income (GNI) per capita as low-income, lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income (http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups).",

In recent decades, there has been an overreliance in the prescription of opioids for chronic pain despite their poor ability to improve function and high addiction liability. This contributed to a significant and alarming epidemic of opioid overdose deaths and addictions. Innovative scientific solutions to develop alternative pain treatment options are thus critically needed.\nThrough targeted research efforts, the NIH HEAL Initiative aims to support the development of safe and effective devices to treat pain with little or no addiction liability. This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is designed to support interdisciplinary research teams of multiple PD/PIs to investigate the mechanism of action of pain relief by medical devices with the overall goal of optimizing therapeutic outcomes for FDA-approved or -cleared technologies. Program teams are expected to accomplish goals that require considerable synergy and collaborative interactions. Teams must leverage appropriate multi-disciplinary expertise to develop new principles and methods for experimentation, analysis, and interpretation. Teams are encouraged to consider objectives that will produce major advances in the field of pain relief by medical devices.",

        "description": "Invasive surgical procedures offer the opportunity for unique intracranial interventions such as the ability to record and stimulate intracranially within precisely localized brain structures in humans. Human studies using invasive technology are often constrained by a limited number of patients and resources available to implement complex experimental protocols and need to be aggregated in a manner that addresses research questions with appropriate statistical power. Therefore, this RFA seeks applications to assemble diverse, integrated, multi-disciplinary teams that cross boundaries of interdisciplinary collaboration to overcome these fundamental barriers and to investigate high-impact questions in human neuroscience. The research should be offered as exploratory research and planning activities to establish feasibility, proof-of-principle and early-stage development that, if successful, would support, enable, and/or lay the groundwork for a potential, subsequent Research Opportunities Using Invasive Neural Recording and Stimulating Technologies in the Human Brain, as described in the companion FOA (RFA-NS-22-041). Projects should maximize opportunities to conduct innovative in vivo neuroscience research made available by direct access to the brain from invasive surgical procedures. Projects should employ approaches guided by specified theoretical constructs and by quantitative, mechanistic models where appropriate.\nAwardees will join a consortium working group, coordinated by the NIH, to identify consensus standards of practice, including neuroethical considerations, to collect and provide data for ancillary studies, and to aggregate and standardize data for dissemination among the wider scientific community.",

This FOA allows applications from eligible NIGMS-funded investigators and from New Investigators proposing research within the scientific mission of NIGMS. The FOA also allows renewal applications from all current MIRA grantees (established investigators and those previously funded as early-stage investigators).

        "description": "This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will support the development of state-of-the-art projects that integrate imaging, biomarkers, digital pathomics, glycomics, metabolomics, other omic information and/or meta data obtained from platforms including but not limited to lower resolution diagnostic acquisitions and systemic biomarker results to high resolution single-cell analytics / imaging applied to the characterization of heterogeneous cell populations within tumor for improving current approaches for: (1) the early detection of organ confined premetastatic aggressive cancer, and, (2) identifying precancerous lesions associated with a subsequent lethal phenotype.  This FOA specifically attempts to address and improve diagnostic uncertainty in clinical decisions by improving detection sensitivity and specificity of integrated multiparametric platforms. For example, N-dimensional co-registered, cross-correlated imaging data integrated with multiplexed biomarker results and/or digital pathomics or glycomic, or metabolomic imaging using analytic strategies such as artificial intelligence or virtual reality visualization techniques.  The projects supported by this FOA will collectively participate in the existing Consortium for Imaging and Biomarkers (CIB) Research Program. The goals of the CIB are to: (1) improve diagnostic performance by developing methodology for the early identification of potentially lethal cancer versus non-lethal disease, (2) to minimize/better manage overdiagnosis and (3) to reduce false positives and false negatives.",

The NIH defines health disparities as differences in the incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and burden of diseases and other adverse health outcomes that exist among specific population groups. These population groups include racial and ethnic minorities (African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other U.S. Pacific Islanders, as well as subpopulations of all of these racial/ethnic groups), socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, sexual and gender minorities, and medically underserved populations including individuals residing in rural and urban areas (see https://www.nimhd/nih.gov/about/overview/). This program seeks advances in medical technologies to reduce health disparities associated with diseases, illnesses, and conditions of public health importance. This announcement encourages applications to develop medical devices, imaging systems, robotic systems, biomaterial interfaces, synthetic biological systems, mathematical and modeling solutions, and other technologies to address the healthcare needs of populations that experience health disparities. Proposed medical technologies must have the following basic characteristics: effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and easily accessible to those who need them. Responsive grant applications will involve a formal collaboration with a healthcare organization or public health agency serving one or more populations that experience health disparities.</p>",

        "description": "<p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);\">This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites applications for P30 Cancer Center Support Grants (CCSGs) to support NCI-designated Cancer Centers. CCSGs support three types of Cancer Centers: 1) Comprehensive Cancer Centers, which demonstrate reasonable depth and breadth of research activities in each of three major areas: basic laboratory; clinical; and prevention, control and population-based research, and which have substantial transdisciplinary research that bridges these scientific areas; and 2) Clinical Cancer Centers, which are primarily focused on basic laboratory; clinical; and prevention, cancer control, and population-based research; or some combination of these areas, and 3) Basic Cancer Centers, which focus on basic laboratory research. The purpose of all types of NCI-designated Cancer Centers is to capitalize on all institutional cancer research capabilities, integrating meritorious research into a single transdisciplinary research enterprise across all institutional boundaries. Cancer Centers supported through this FOA are expected to serve as major sources of discovery of the nature of cancer and of development of more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and therapy; to contribute significantly to the development of Shared Resources that support research; to collaborate and coordinate their research efforts with other NCI-funded programs and investigators; and to disseminate research findings for the benefit of the community.</span></p>",

        "description": "<p>The U.S. Army Research Office (ARO) in partnership with NSA’s Laboratory for Physical Science (LPS) is soliciting Incubator, Collaboration, and Fellowship research proposals for participation in the LPS Qubit Collaboratory (LQC). The mission of the LQC can be captured in three broad goals: 1) pursue disruptive fundamental research and enabling technologies with a focus on qubit development for quantum computing and other applications (such as sensing); 2) grow deep, collaborative partnerships to tackle the most difficult and relevant long-term problems in quantum information science and technology; and 3) build a quantum workforce of tomorrow through research experiences in government at LPS and at LQC partners. The LQC will offer a mechanism for collaborative research between LPS and academia, industry, FFRDCs, and Government Laboratories to advance foundational and transformative research on challenging problems that have hindered progress in quantum information processing and associated technologies.</p><p><br></p><p>The goal of this BAA is to seek proposals that bring together expertise from the public and private sectors and their respective research infrastructures to advance solutions that may be best approached as a collaborative team. A Collaboratory is “a center without walls, in which the nation’s researchers can perform their research without regard to physical location, interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources, [and] accessing information in&nbsp;digital libraries.&nbsp;This BAA introduces LQC Research Thrusts (<strong>A.1.1</strong>) which are the technical areas of interest—which will be updated periodically—where partners of the LQC will pursue joint research with LPS through Incubator (<strong>A.1.2</strong>) and Collaboration (<strong>A.1.3</strong>) collaborative agreements. The LQC BAA also fulfills the Government’s overarching interest--through the proposed research and on-site research experiences--in creating and training a workforce in quantum science and technology, generating pathways of solutions that feed technology development, establishing partnerships, and creating transition opportunities. In further support of training through research, <strong>Section A.1.4</strong> calls for Quantum Computing Research (QuaCR) Graduate and Postdoctoral Fellowships for US citizens working in areas of interest.</p><p><br></p><p>Substantial progress on solving the most difficult and long-term Quantum Information Science &amp; Technology (QIST) research problems that unleash further rapid progress in the field will constitute LQC success.&nbsp;Examples of such research problems include (but are not limited to): limits of performance due to device design, material selection, and/or control, the exploration of alternative qubit physics (e.g., different approaches to qubit encoding or types of gates) and lowering of barriers to such approaches, advances in materials that improve qubit gate fidelity, reducing the overhead of classical components in quantum information technology and optimizing classical performance, and the exploration of applications of quantum technologies to new domains.</p><p><br></p><p>Three categories of proposals are sought for this BAA:</p><p><strong>1.Incubator</strong> opportunities seek partnership proposals from single investigators and small research groups, including teaching colleges, who may have unique skillsets to contribute toward the pursuit of the research thrusts presented in A.1.1.&nbsp;Incubator proposals may also be the development of concepts into a detailed technical research approach to advance solution of problems of high interest to quantum information science research.&nbsp;Incubator proposals would avail themselves of the collaboration opportunities with LPS research staff and infrastructure made available at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences (LPS) to lay the groundwork for concepts that may be suitable for a Collaboratory proposal or responses to other DoD quantum information science research opportunities.</p><p><strong>2.Collaboratory</strong> proposals seek research proposals that bring together a strong significant collaboration--researchers from academia, industry, FFRDCs, and/or Government Laboratories--to pursue long-term projects focused on fundamental problems of interest to qubit development and/or associated science and technology.&nbsp;These collaborative groups will propose to work together in a focused manner for a period of time expected to be one to three years in order to demonstrate a proof-of-concept experiment and/or theory exploration to determine the feasibility of their creative idea.</p><p><strong>3.QuaCR Research Fellowship</strong> proposals seek to support talented U.S. citizen graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the field of quantum information processing (primary interest) and quantum sensing (secondary interest). Applicants with a background from either within or outside QIS are encouraged. The proposed research areas are described in this BAA and must enhance active Quantum Information Science research efforts being supported by the Army Research Office and/or LPS. Research fellows are encouraged to complete an LPS Internship during their graduate career or visit during their postdoctoral fellowship</p>",
